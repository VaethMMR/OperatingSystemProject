# OperatingSystemProject
A simulated microkernel OS implemented in C from school. 

Demonstrates: 
	scheduling algorithms
	asynchronous programming across multiple processes 
	mutex
	semaphores/synchronization data structures 
	demand paging system with multiple pager daemons
	device drivers including disk, terminal, and clock drivers
	i/o
	access control
	kernel/user security interfacing
	vectors/concurrent data structure handling
	proper resource sharing and process termination/cleanup

The USLOSS simulator is a simulated OS that handles the low level simulations of various OS devices and dispatcher events such as context switching. 
The software responsibilities of an OS are designed start to finish from scratch to interface with these devices via bit registries
